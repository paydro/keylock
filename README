Keylock
-------

Keylock is a javascript library used to map browser keyboard events to javascript functions. Keylock is also geared towards Vi users. The keybindings use the same format the Vi bindings have.

Here's an example keybinding that alerts the user:

    var keys = new Keylock();
    keys.define
